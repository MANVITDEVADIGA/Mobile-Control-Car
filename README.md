ESP32 Mobile-Controlled Car ðŸš—ðŸ”Œ
Project Overview
This project features a mobile-controlled car built using an ESP32 microcontroller, an L298N motor driver, and four DC motors. The car is powered by two batteries and utilizes a PCB-based chassis for a compact and efficient design. It includes LED indicators for braking, reversing, and turning.

Features
Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Control: Communicate with the ESP32 via a mobile app or web interface.

Motor Control: L298N motor driver regulates movement (forward, reverse, turns).

LED Indicators: Brake, reverse, and turn lights for visual feedback.

Custom PCB Chassis: Optimized for stability and component integration.

Enhancements
PWM for speed control

Obstacle avoidance using sensors

IoT integration for real-time telemetry

Camera streaming for FPV remote control

Installation & Setup
Connect ESP32 to the L298N motor driver.

Wire up DC motors, batteries, and LED indicators.

Upload control code via Arduino IDE or ESP-IDF.

Pair with mobile app for remote operation.
